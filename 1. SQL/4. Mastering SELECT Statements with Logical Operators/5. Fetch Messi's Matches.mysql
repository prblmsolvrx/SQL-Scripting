/*
Write a SELECT query to retrieve matches from the Matches table where Lionel Messi played a match during year 2019 or 2020, on matchdays between 1 and 15, and where the result was either a win with a score of '4:1' or '5:2'. Use the IN, BETWEEN, and OR operators in your query, and remember to group conditions for clarity.

Hereâ€™s a skeleton to help you get started:

SQL
Copy
SELECT * FROM Matches
WHERE (condition1)
      AND (condition2)
      AND (condition3);
*/


-- TODO: Fetch matches from year 2019 or 2020, on matchdays between 1 and 15, where the result was either 4:1 or 5:2

SELECT * FROM Matches
WHERE YEAR(date) IN (2019, 2020)
      AND matchday BETWEEN 1 AND 15
      AND (result = '4:1' OR result = '5:2');
